#Could not open files. I struggled to open them inside the master folder, it appeared a message I could not solve the problem, marked a problem with the branches.
#In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will give a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)
#Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
#The total number of months included in the dataset
#The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
#The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
#The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

import os
import csv

#Get path
PyBank_path: os.path.join('budget_data.csv')
